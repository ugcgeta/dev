###Based Upon rpi_ws281x

`unicornhat` is based upon a modified, Pi 2/3 compatible version of the RPi ws281x Library by Jeremy Garff.

The library was modified by Richard Hirst.

* Modified version: https://github.com/richardghirst/rpi_ws281x
* Original: https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x

###RaspberryPi-NeoPixel-WS2812

Note: `unicornhat` is no longer based upon this library, but this information is included for posterity.

`unicornhat` was previously based upon a modified version of the ws2812 C driver from: https://github.com/626Pilot/RaspberryPi-NeoPixel-WS2812
